This is a paragrah.
All sentences in paragraphs are written on their own line.
Because of this it's very easy to notice problems in the flow of the text.

[[sub_heading_id]]
== This is a subheading

This heading has an id.
Which we can reference, like this xref:sub_heading_id[]

== Links are done like this

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aslakhol/asciidoc-thesis-template/main/presentation/examples.adoc[Raw asciidoc text]

They can be created by simply importing csv files.

.This is the table text.
[format="csv", options="header"]
